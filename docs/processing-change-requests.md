# Processing change requests

In the navigation menu, go to *Contacts* â†’ *Process Pending Update Requests* to
load the I3Val batch processing interface.

I3Val will, according to the batching options, create a batch of change requests
and show the first item. How many items are left in your batch is being shown
with a progress bar.

Below, you will see the following information:

*   *With Contact* - the contact the change was requested for
*   *Subject* - the subject of the change request activity
*   *Campaign* - (optional) the campaign associated to the change request
*   *Scheduled Date* - the date the changes were requested
*   *Status* - the status of the change request activity

Each configured data processing handler will now list the changes it can
process. For each field requested to be changed, the following values will be
shown:

*   *Original Value* - The value the field had when the change was requested
*   *Submitted Value* - The value the field was requested to be set to
*   *Current Value* - The current value of the field (may differ from the
    original value)

The next column provides a widget for you to choose a value to set when
confirming the change request. This may be either of the three aforementioned
values or the one you set manually (e.g. to correct spelling errors).

Depending on the processor type, further options may be required to be set, e.g.
for contact details (e-mail addresses, phone numbers, addresses, etc.) which
location type to use and whether to create a new detail entry or overwrite the
existing one.

By hitting *Apply*, the change request is being confirmed and the changes
written to the contact and/or its details.

When being unsure about what to do with the change request, it can be postponed
for a selectable time, or it can be flagged as "problematic", which makes it not
appear again in batches and be marked for manual investigation.
